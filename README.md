#Steps and thoughts
* Created initial project structure:
    * For proper separation two different Git repositories could be used. But for simplicity I decided to have one
    multi-project build, which holds two services.
    * Added git ignore
    * Added readme file (current)
    * Created git repo on GitHub
    * Configured remote
    * Pushing initial commit
* Investigated the gRPC
    * Added common gRPC dependencies to the parent pom
* Added Spring boot and Jersey dependencies to the proxy-service module
* Polished initial structure
* Proceed with core project structure configuration
* Jersey and REST endpoint(s) configuration
* Completed the basic flow without unit tests, exception handling and fibonacci function
