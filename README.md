#Steps and thoughts
* Created initial project structure:
    * For proper separation two different Git repositories could be used. But for simplicity I decided to have one
    multi-project build, which holds two services.
    * Added gitignore
    * Added readme file (current)
    * Created git repo on GitHub
    * Configured remote
    * Pushing initial commit
